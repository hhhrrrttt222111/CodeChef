## Introduction 
So you are interested to contribute to open-source? Looking for your first PR (pull request, silly!)? This repository welcomes contributions from anyone passionate about Competitive Programming. 

## Wait, What is Competitive Programming? :confused:   

In a gist, it's a mental sport where you compete with others to write programs for a problem. The program which takes the least time wins! Of course, not all programs are trivial and that is when you need to use Data Structures and Algorithms judiciously. 

For a more theoretical sermon, please click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming). 

## Why should I do Competitive Programming? :thinking:

Great question! 

Again, in a gist, they look great on resumes! And recruiters look forward to people who are acquainted with CP. It assures them that _you_ can practically implement all that you have theoretically learned.

## I am excited! How do I get in?

Great to have you onboard! There are a _number_ of online sites which offer practise problems which are judged by the site computers. You not only get to compete (and hence improve) against other competitors but you can also learn from them by posting to forums. Some platforms have great communities for beginners! 

[Sign Up on CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/signup) 

Other sites to consider: Hackerrank, CodeForces, SPOJ, LeetCode, Project Euler and many more!

## What is this repo for? 

This repository aims to bring everyone into the competitive coding world. It contains the solutions of all coding problems in CodeChef in multiple languages to help you get started. 

Browse and understand how solutions are written and graded. Practise on CodeChef and friends. And when you are ready... 

## Contribute! 

Complete CodeChef solutions in _any_ of these languages (Python, Java, C, C++, Ruby, JS, etc) is accepted. 

Just make sure that your solution passes all the test cases and read [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines to be followed.
