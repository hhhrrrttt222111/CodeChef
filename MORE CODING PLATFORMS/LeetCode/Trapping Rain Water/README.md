### Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, 
compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1**

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

Output: 6

**Example 2**

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]

Output: 9

**Constraints:**

n == height.length

1 <= n <= 2 * 104

0 <= height[i] <= 105
