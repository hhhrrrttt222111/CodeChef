# Nothing is a quick process and there is no shortcut for Success.🧘 💻

*Competitive Coding*💻 _is not just a subject it's a sport which you can't master only with theory, it requires a lot of problem solving practice._

*Many people think that it's only for people with high IQ*😵 *, But trust me it is not the case*😄 _. Anyone can do well with competitive coding provided his/her concepts on data structures and algorithms are strong._

## Here are some resources which could help be a better programmer.

#### MyCodeSchool is a really great channel for understanding theory of programming, It covers various concepts on DSA and time complexity.

#### One of the best books For clearing programming interviews, Suggested at little later stages when you get your hands good at problem solving and interviews are approaching.

**[Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.in/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview/dp/0984782869/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&qid=1603566768&sr=8-2)**
